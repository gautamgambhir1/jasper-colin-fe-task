## Getting Started

### Installation

Before running the development server, ensure you have `pnpm` installed. If you don't have it installed, you can do so by running:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Running the Development Server

Once `pnpm` is installed, install the dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a> in your browser to see the result.

### Formatting Code

To format the code, run:

```sh
pnpm fmt
```

### Linting Code

To lint and check for issues, run:

```sh
pnpm lint
```

To automatically fix linting issues, run:

```sh
pnpm lint --fix
```
